# Simple Discord Bot (Example)

IMPORTANT: This bot is for demonstration purposes only and must NOT be used, deployed, or distributed.

This repository contains a minimal, professionally structured example of a Discord bot written in Node.js. It demonstrates a modular command loader, basic error handling, and structured logging. It is not intended for production use.

## What it does

- Responds to `!ping` with a latency measurement.
- Provides a `!help` command that lists available commands.

## Local testing (for development only)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `BOT_TOKEN` if you need to test locally (DO NOT commit `.env` to a public repository):
   ```powershell
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and insert your bot token (not recommended for public repos)
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the bot:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

Notes:
- If `BOT_TOKEN` is not present the process will log an error and exit.
- The bot listens for commands prefixed with `!`.

## Security

Do not store secrets (bot tokens) in the repository. Use environment variables or a secrets manager. `.env` is ignored by `.gitignore`.

## Extending this example

Suggested improvements you can make:

- Add more commands under the `commands/` folder using the same `module.exports = { name, description, execute }` pattern.
- Add command permission checks and argument parsing.
- Add unit tests and linting.
- Convert to TypeScript for stronger typing.

If you want, I can help implement any of the above enhancements.
